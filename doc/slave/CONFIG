install the debile-slave package
configure /etc/debile/slave.yaml

 - set xmrpc.{host,password,user} to sane values for the setup above

 - if you have an OpenPGP for your Debile user already
   - use debile-remote create-slave on your dev machine (remotely) - you'll
     need to set /etc/debile/user.yaml correctly.
   otherwise:
   - use /usr/share/python-debile/debile-generate-slave-keys on your dev
     machine (remotely) - you'll need to set /etc/debile/user.yaml correctly.
   - copy the generated .tar.gz to the slave
   - sudo /usr/share/debile-slave/debile-slave-import-{conf,gpg} name.tar.gz

 - restart the slave daemon
