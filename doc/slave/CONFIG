Debile slave documentation
--------------------------


This file documents how to install a Debile Slave.


Install the debile-slave package
Configure /etc/debile/slave.yaml

- set xmrpc.{host,keyfile,certfile} to sane values for the setup above

If you have an OpenPGP for your Debile user already:
 - use debile-remote create-slave on your dev machine (remotely) - you'll need to set /etc/debile/user.yaml correctly. See the master CONFIG file for more information.

Otherwise:

 - use /usr/share/python-debile/debile-generate-slave-keys on your dev machine (remotely) - you'll need to set /etc/debile/user.yaml correctly.
 - copy the generated .tar.gz to the slave
 - sudo /usr/share/debile-slave/debile-slave-import-{conf,cred} name.tar.gz


Install devscripts::
        apt-get install devscripts

Install dput-ng::
        apt-get install dput-ng

/etc/dput.d/profiles/ursae.json::
    {
        "fqdn": "ursae.inria.fr",
        "incoming": "/UploadQueue",
        "login": "anonymous",
        "meta": "boring",
        "method": "ftp"
    }

/etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf::

Allow parallel build:

   $build_environment = {
     'DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS' => 'parallel=8'
   };

- restart the slave daemon


Clang command
=============

The clang check requires

- that the script contrib/debian/debile-switch-to-clang is in
/usr/share/debile-slave/ in the chroot

- that sbuild has been patched with https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=608840#27

clemux's patched sbuild and libsbuild-perl can be found on http://www.mux.me/debile/
