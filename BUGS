[x] - Add init script for the server
[x] - Have the client crash in less sucky ways
[x]   - Server being down 
[ ]   - Network breaking / can't dput
[ ] - Find a way to keep chroots updated
          (Ideas: docker based updater on the central server - tarballs
           as a service / TaaS :) )
[x] - Fix adequite to no longer prompt for things (see how piuparts does
      this?)
[ ] - Find a way to forward "clean" builds via magic to other servers after
      they get fully built in debile (to allow PPA-alikes backed by debile)
[ ] - Docker integration? Allow hosts to spawn Docker containers? Adding new
      nodes will be easier and safer
